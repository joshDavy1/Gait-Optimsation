## Abstract

Traditionally the gaits of legged robots are inspired by what is seen in nature and
on assumptions of what properties the optimum gait would have. This involves
kinematic and dynamic analysis of the robot which becomes increasingly difficult
with robots with greater degrees of freedom. Further, real actuators and joints
are not ideal and are also difficult to mathematically model accurately. In this
project the aim is to use optimisation techniques to allow a robot to develop its
own gait free from human bias of what the optimum gait would look like. This
technique means no kinematic or dynamic analysis of a robot is necessary, as
the robot will attempt to learn a policy of moving its joints to optimise its gait.
The project will consist of two main sections, firstly the design and build of
a suitable robotic platform for experimentation and secondly, the investigation
and design of suitable software to control the robotic platform.
